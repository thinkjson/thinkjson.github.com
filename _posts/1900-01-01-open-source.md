## Featured projects

### [Redbox mashup](movies.thinkjson.com)

This application combines Redbox inventory with Rotten Tomatoes scores to show you the top 50 highest rated movies in the 5 Redbox kiosks closest to your zip code. This is an automatation of a process I was going through every Friday night. Building this as a web app means others can take advantage of the tool as well. This is my first experiment with content discovery, a field that I am becoming increasingly interested in.

### [Right brain](rightbrain.thinkjson.com)

A trippy experiment in right brain stimulation, this application pulls down dozens of photos from the Flickr API and displays them in a CSS-driven slideshow. I use this give my left brain a rest between difficult tasks.
