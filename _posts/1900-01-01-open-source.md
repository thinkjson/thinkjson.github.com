The following is a list of open source projects I am involved in:

### [Saiku](http://www.analytical-labs.com/)

Role: core developer

Saiku is a modular analysis suite offering a RESTful server, JackRabbit workspace management, OAuth security management and communication in JSON or XML. Our aim is to make embedding data analysis in your application as simple as possible. Saiku also offers a highly functional JQuery based frontend for easy setup and run. This is also completely RESTful and communicates with our server via JSON. I'm mostly working on frontend stuff at the moment.

### [Ypy](http://yieldproject.org/ypy.html)

Role: contibuter

Ypy is a blazing fast WSGI-compliant Python application server. It utilizes asynchronous I/O and a Ragel HTTP parser to reap increased performance over a tradition Apache+mod_wsgi setup.

### Github projects
